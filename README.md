Thor Swapper is the ultimate window management utility designed specifically for the AYN Thor. It provides a "magical," seamless way to move active applications between the top and bottom displays instantly, even while playing full-screen games.

How it Works: By leveraging Root access to monitor low-level input events, Thor Swapper detects gestures regardless of what is currently running on the screen.

Intuitive Gestures: Simply perform a multi-finger swipe (configurable for 3 or 4 fingers) on the screen.

Swipe DOWN on the Top Screen to send the app to the bottom.

Swipe UP on the Bottom Screen to bring the app to the top.

Physical Button Shortcuts: Long-press the physical HOME button to instantly open the Recent Apps overview, solving navigation issues in full-screen mode.

Key Features:

🚀 Instant Swapping: Move apps between screens with zero lag and a slick dark animation.

🎮 Works Over Games: The gesture overlay functions perfectly even on top of demanding 3D games where standard Android gestures fail.

⚙️ Highly Configurable: Choose between 3 or 4-finger swipe modes and fine-tune sensitivity for each screen independently.

🏠 Home Button Fix: Easily access "Recents" with a long-press action.

🎨 Modern UI: A clean, dark-themed settings interface.

⚠️ IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: This application REQUIRES ROOT ACCESS (Magisk) to function. It needs elevated privileges to intercept raw touch events and manage system windows aggressively. It will not work on unrooted devices. To root your device you can use [O2P Tweaks App](https://github.com/FeralAI/o2ptweaks.app)


Suggestions are welcome :)
